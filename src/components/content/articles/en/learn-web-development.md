```javascript
// Simple example of interactivity
document.querySelector("h1").addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Hello! Welcome to my website.");
});

// Using modern features (ES6+)
const technologies = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"];
technologies.forEach((tech) => console.log(`I'm learning ${tech}`));
```
