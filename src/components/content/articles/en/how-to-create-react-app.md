# How to Create a React Application in 2025

In 2025, developers have several options for creating a React application. Tools have evolved significantly since the days when Create React App was the go-to solution. In this guide, we'll explore different modern methods to quickly and efficiently start a React project.

## Is Create React App Obsolete?

Create React App (CRA) was long the reference tool for beginners, but in 2025, it's no longer recommended for new projects for several reasons:

- Limited configuration without "ejecting" the application
- Slower development performance than modern alternatives
- Limited support for the latest React features and ecosystem

Nevertheless, if you still want to use it for compatibility reasons:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-application
cd my-application
npm start
```

## Vite: The Recommended Modern Alternative

Vite has become the tool of choice for starting new React projects in 2025. It offers:

- An ultra-fast development server
- Optimized build times
- Flexible configuration via plugins

To create a React project with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-application -- --template react-ts
cd my-application
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `--template react-ts` flag uses TypeScript, highly recommended for any modern React project.

## Next.js for a Complete Application

If you need more advanced features like server-side rendering, API routes, or static site generation, Next.js is the ideal option:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-application
```

The wizard will ask you several questions to configure your project according to your needs, including whether you want to use TypeScript, TailwindCSS, etc.

## Recommended Project Structure in 2025

Regardless of your approach, here's an optimal folder structure:

```
src/
├── assets/        # Images, fonts, etc.
├── components/    # Reusable components
│   ├── ui/        # Generic interface components
│   └── layout/    # Layout components
├── hooks/         # Custom hooks
├── features/      # Functional modules (by domain)
├── services/      # Services (API, authentication...)
├── types/         # TypeScript types
└── utils/         # Utility functions
```

## Essential Configuration for 2025

For a modern React project, make sure to include:

1. **TypeScript** for type safety
2. **ESLint** with the latest React rules
3. **Prettier** for code formatting
4. **Vitest** or **Jest** for testing
5. **TailwindCSS** or another modern styling system

## Conclusion

Although Create React App has been an excellent starting point for years, modern tools like Vite and Next.js offer a faster and more enjoyable experience for developing React applications in 2025. Adopt these new solutions to benefit from the best performance and the latest features of the React ecosystem.
